GNU Unifont Glyphs
------------------

GNU Unifont is part of the GNU Project. This page contains the latest release of GNU 
Unifont, with glyphs for every printable code point in the Unicode Basic Multilingual 
Plane (BMP). The BMP occupies the first 65,536 code points of the Unicode space, 
denoted as U+0000..U+FFFF. 

Commercial Use
--------------

A user has asked if GNU Unifont can be used with commercial (non-free) software. The 
answer is yes. The GNU Font Embedding Exception and the SIL OFL allow for that.
